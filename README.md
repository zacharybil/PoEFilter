# ayebeesee's Item Filter Script
# This scripts aims to:
	# Show all items you want to pick up with borders
	# Show all super rare items as purple text (fishing rods for example)
	# Show items you should consider picking up
	# Hide items you will never want
	# Shown items have smaller font size as to reduce screen clutter (generally rarer stuff is not smaller)
	# 2 Chaos/Regal recipe shows low bases
